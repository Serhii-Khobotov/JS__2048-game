## JS__2048-game

  A crisp, interactive implementation of the classic 2048 game built with plain JavaScript and styled to match modern UI standards.

## Description:

  This project delivers a fully playable, browser-based version of 2048—the addictive sliding tile puzzle game. Users can merge tiles using arrow keys to reach the coveted 2048 tile. Clean UI, smooth animations, and polished UX ensure a delightful gaming experience.

## Technologies:

  - HTML5 – Semantic structure

  - CSS3 – Grid layout, transitions, responsive styling

  - JavaScript (ES6+) – Game logic, state updates, animations, and keyboard handling

  - No external libraries—just pure vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML

##  Key Features:

  🔲 Dynamic Grid – 4×4 game board with sliding tiles and merging rules

  🎯 Tile Merging Logic – Combines equal tiles, handles scoring, prevents illegal moves

  🚦 Smooth Animations – CSS transitions for tile movement and merging feedback

  📈 Score Tracking – Displays current score.

  ♻️ Game Controls – "Restart" button to restart, visual updates on each move

  ✅ Win/Lose Detection – Alerts when you win (2048) or no more moves are possible
